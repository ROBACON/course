    "Let's turn to biological circuits.\n",
    "We will start by thinking about a single gene, coding for a single corresponding protein. This minimal example will allow us to develop intuition for the dynamics of the simplest gene regulations systems and lay out a procedure that we can further extend to analyze more complex circuits. \n",
    "\n",
    "What protein concentration will be produced by a gene *x*? We assume that the gene will be transcribed to mRNA and those mRNA molecules will in turn be translated to produce proteins, such that new proteins are produced at a total rate $\\beta$ molecules per unit time. The $x$ protein does not simply accumulate over time. It is also removed both through active degradation as well as dilution as cells grow and divide. For simplicity, we will assume that both processes tend to reduce protein concentrations through a simple first-order process, with a rate constant $\\gamma$. \n",

Instead, we assume those steps give rise to \"coarse grained\" relationships that we can model in a manner that is independent of many underlying molecular details. The test of this approach is whether it allows us to understand and experimentally predict the behavior of real biological systems.

    "*A note on effective degradation rates*: When cells are growing, protein is removed through both  degradation and dilution. For stable proteins, dilution dominates. For very unstable proteins, whose half-life is much smaller than the cell cycle period, dilution may be negligible. In bacteria, mRNA half-lives (1-10 min, typically) are much shorter than protein half-lives. In eukaryotic cells this is not necessarily true (mRNA half-lives can be many hours in mammalian cells)."

    "## From gene expression to gene regulation - adding a repressor\n",
    "\n",
    "Life would be simple—perhaps too simple—if genes were simply left \"on\" all the time. To make things interesting the cell has to regulate them, turning their expression levels lower or higher depending on environmental conditions and other inputs. One of the simplest ways to do this is through repressors. Repressors are proteins that can bind to specific binding sites at or near a promoter to change its activity. Often the strength of their binding is contingent on external inputs. For example, the LacI repressor normally turns off the genes for lactose utilization in *E. coli*. However, in the presence of lactose in the media, a modified form of lactose binds to LacI, inhibiting its ability to repress its target genes. Thus, a nutrient (lactose) can regulate expression of genes that allow the cell to use it. (For the scientific and historical saga of this seemingly simple system, we recommend the fascinating, wonderful book [\"The lac operon\"](https://www.amazon.com/lac-Operon-Benno-Müller-Hill/dp/3110148307) by B. Müller-Hill.)\n",

    "Within the cell, the repressor binds and unbinds its target site. We assume that the expression level of the gene is lower when the repressor is bound and higher when it is unbound. The mean expression level of the gene is then proportional to the fraction of time that the repressor is unbound. \n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore compute the \"concentration\" of DNA sites in occupied or unoccupied states. (Within a single cell an individual site on the DNA is either bound or unbound, but averaged over a population of cells, we can talk about the mean occupancy of the site). Let $D$ be the concentration of unoccupied promoter, $D_\\mathrm{occ}$ be the concentration of occupied promoter, and $D_\\mathrm{tot}$ be the total concentration of promoter, with $D_\\mathrm{tot} = D + D_\\mathrm{occ}$, as required by conservation of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also assume a **separation of timescales** between the rates of binding and unbinding of the repressor to the DNA binding site are both often fast compared to the timescales over which mRNA and protein concentrations vary. (Careful, however, in some contexts, such as mammalian cells, this is not true.) \n",

    "Genes can be regulated by activators as well as repressors. Treating the case of activation just involves switching the state that is actively expressing from the unbound one to the one bound by the protein (now called an Activator). And, just as the binding of a repressor to DNA can be modulated by small molecule inputs, so too can the binding of the activator be modulated by binding to small molecules. In bacteria, one of many examples is the [arabinose regulation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-arabinose_operon).\n",

    "## Activator vs. Repressor–which to choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "*And now at last we have reached our first true 'design' question:* The cell has at least two different ways to regulate a gene: using an activator or using a repressor. Which should it choose? Which would you choose if you were designing a synthetic circuit? Why? Are they completely equivalent ways to regulate a target gene? Is one better in some or all conditions? How could we know?  \n",
    "\n",
    "These questions were  posed in a [study by Michael Savageau (PNAS, 1974)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC388476/), who tried to explain the naturally observed usage of activation and repression in bacteria. A different explanation was later developed by [Shinar et al (PNAS 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506610103). We end the lecture with this question - try to think about when and why you would use each type of regulation! \n",
